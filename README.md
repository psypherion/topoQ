# topoQ
topoQ is a Python library for simulating topological quantum computing via non‑Abelian anyon braiding. It offers modular circuit construction, advanced error models, variational optimization, and interactive visualization tools to design and analyze measurement‑based quantum gates for fault‑tolerant computation.
